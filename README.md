# 📉 Telco Customer Churn Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
In this project, I analyzed a dataset of **7,000 telecom customers** to predict who is likely to cancel their subscription (churn). By understanding these patterns, businesses can take proactive steps to retain valuable customers.

## 🎥 Video Demo & Explanation
I have explained the full end-to-end process (from data cleaning to model building) in this video:

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn
* **Model:** Decision Tree Classifier

## 📊 Key Insights
1.  **Contract Type:** Customers with Month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn compared to 1-2 year contracts.
2.  **Monthly Charges:** Customers with Monthly Charges of around $80-$100 have a high churn rate.

## 🚀 How to Run
1.  Download the `Telco-Customer-Churn.csv` file.
2.  Open `Telco_Churn_Analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3.  Run all cells to see the analysis and model accuracy.
